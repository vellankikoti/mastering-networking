# BGP: Border Gateway Protocol

## **Definition**
BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) is the protocol that manages how packets are routed across the internet by exchanging routing information between autonomous systems (AS). It’s often called the "backbone of the internet."

---

## **Why is BGP Important?**
- **Scalability:** Handles the vast number of routes on the global internet.
- **Policy-Based Routing:** Allows ISPs and organizations to control traffic paths.
- **Reliability:** Ensures redundancy and failover.

---

## **Key Features of BGP**
1. **Path Vector Protocol:** Maintains path information for making routing decisions.
2. **Policy Control:** Allows administrators to set routing policies.
3. **Incremental Updates:** Sends updates only for changes, reducing overhead.
4. **Scalable:** Supports millions of routes.

## **How BGP Works**

1. **Neighbor Relationships (Peering):**
   - Routers establish a TCP session to exchange routing information.
   - Example: ISP A peers with ISP B to exchange internet routes.

2. **Route Advertisement:**
   - Routers advertise available networks to their peers.
   - Example: ISP A advertises the IP range `203.0.113.0/24` to ISP B.

3. **Best Path Selection:**
   - BGP uses attributes like AS path, MED, and local preference to select the best route.
   - Example: Router chooses a shorter AS path over a longer one.

4. **Route Propagation:**
   - Updates are propagated to other routers only when changes occur.

## **BGP Attributes**

| **Attribute**      | **Description**                                  |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **AS Path**         | Lists the autonomous systems a route passes through. |
| **Next Hop**        | Specifies the next router in the path.          |
| **Local Preference**| Determines preferred exit paths for outgoing traffic. |
| **Multi-Exit Discriminator (MED)** | Suggests preferred entry points for incoming traffic. |

## **Real-Life Example: How the Internet Works with BGP**

### Scenario:
Imagine a user in Bengaluru accessing *vellanki.in* hosted on a server in New York:
1. **User Request:** The request is sent from the user’s ISP in Bengaluru to an upstream ISP.
2. **Route Selection:** ISPs use BGP to determine the best path to New York.
3. **Path Propagation:** BGP ensures the request traverses multiple autonomous systems efficiently.
4. **Server Response:** The server in New York sends the data back via the same or a different optimized path.

## **Hands-On: Configuring BGP**

### **Lab Setup:**
1. Use Cisco Packet Tracer or GNS3.
2. Create two routers simulating two autonomous systems (AS).

### **Steps:**
1. **Enable BGP:**
   ```bash
   Router(config)# router bgp 65001
   ```

2. **Define Neighbors:**
   ```bash
   Router(config-router)# neighbor 192.168.1.2 remote-as 65002
   ```

3. **Advertise Networks:**
   ```bash
   Router(config-router)# network 10.0.0.0 mask 255.255.255.0
   ```

4. **Verify Peers:**
   ```bash
   Router# show ip bgp summary
   ```

5. **Test Connectivity:**
   Use the `ping` command to verify routes between AS.

## **Analyzing BGP with Wireshark**

### **Setup:**
1. Start Wireshark on a router's interface.
2. Capture BGP packets during neighbor establishment.

### **Steps:**
1. Filter packets using:
   ```bash
   tcp.port == 179
   ```
   - Port 179 is used for BGP.
2. Observe:
   - **OPEN Messages:** Establishment of BGP sessions.
   - **UPDATE Messages:** Route advertisements.
   - **KEEPALIVE Messages:** Keep the session active.
3. Correlate the captured data with router logs.

     +-------------+       +-------------+       +-------------+
     |   AS 65001  |-------|   AS 65002  |-------|   AS 65003  |
     +-------------+       +-------------+       +-------------+
             |                     |                     |
             +---------------------+---------------------+
                              Internet
```

## **Common Issues and Troubleshooting**
1. **BGP Session Not Established:**
   - Check TCP connectivity (port 179).
   - Verify neighbor configurations.

2. **Routing Loops:**
   - Ensure correct AS path configuration.
   - Check for missing route filters.

3. **High Latency:**
   - Analyze AS path and optimize policies.
