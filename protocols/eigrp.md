# EIGRP: Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol

## **Definition**
EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol) is a dynamic routing protocol used within autonomous systems to determine the best path for data. Itâ€™s an advanced version of IGRP, offering faster convergence and more efficient network resource utilization.

---

## **Why Use EIGRP?**
- **Fast Convergence:** Quickly adapts to network changes.
- **Efficient Resource Utilization:** Balances load across multiple links.
- **Scalability:** Works well in large networks.
- **Dual Algorithm:** Ensures loop-free and optimal paths.

---

## **Key Features of EIGRP**
1. **Hybrid Protocol:** Combines the best of link-state and distance-vector protocols.
2. **DUAL Algorithm:** Ensures loop-free and backup paths.
3. **Metric Calculation:** Uses bandwidth, delay, load, and reliability.
4. **Partial Updates:** Sends updates only when routes change.
5. **Neighbor Discovery:** Keeps track of directly connected routers.

---

## **How EIGRP Works**
1. **Neighbor Discovery:**
   - Routers exchange Hello packets to identify neighbors.
   - Example: Router A sends Hello to Router B; B replies, forming a neighbor relationship.
   
2. **Route Advertisement:**
   - Routers share their routing tables with neighbors.
   - Example: Router A advertises its connected networks to Router B.

3. **DUAL Calculation:**
   - EIGRP calculates the best path using the DUAL algorithm.
   - Backup routes are also calculated.

4. **Route Maintenance:**
   - Updates are sent only when a route changes, reducing overhead.

## **EIGRP Packet Types**
- **Hello Packets:** For neighbor discovery.
- **Update Packets:** Share routing information.
- **Query Packets:** Request information about routes.
- **Reply Packets:** Respond to queries.
- **Acknowledgment Packets:** Confirm receipt of updates.

---

## **EIGRP Metric Calculation**
The metric is calculated using the formula:
\[
\text{Metric} = \left( \text{Bandwidth} + \text{Delay} \right) \times 256
\]
- **Bandwidth:** Minimum bandwidth on the path.
- **Delay:** Sum of delays along the path.

### **Example:**
- Path from A to C has:
  - Bandwidth: 1000 Kbps
  - Delay: 10 ms
- Metric:
  \[
  \text{Metric} = \left( \frac{10^7}{1000} + 10 \right) \times 256 = 256256
  \]

## **Real-Life Example: Office Network**
### Scenario:
An office has three departments (IT, HR, Sales) connected via routers:
1. **Router A:** Connects IT.
2. **Router B:** Connects HR.
3. **Router C:** Connects Sales.

EIGRP ensures:
- Fast communication between departments.
- Backup paths in case of router failure.

## **Hands-On: Configuring EIGRP**

### **Lab Setup:**
1. Use Cisco Packet Tracer or GNS3.
2. Create three routers connected in a triangle topology.

### **Steps:**
1. **Enable EIGRP:**
   ```bash
   Router(config)# router eigrp 100
   ```
   - `100` is the Autonomous System (AS) number.

2. **Configure Networks:**
   ```bash
   Router(config-router)# network 192.168.1.0
   Router(config-router)# network 10.0.0.0
   ```

3. **Verify Neighbors:**
   ```bash
   Router# show ip eigrp neighbors
   ```

4. **Verify Routes:**
   ```bash
   Router# show ip route
   ```

5. **Test Connectivity:**
   Use the `ping` command to test connections between routers.

## **Analyzing EIGRP with Wireshark**

### **Setup:**
1. Start Wireshark on a router's interface.
2. Capture EIGRP packets during neighbor discovery.

### **Steps:**
1. Filter packets using:
   ```bash
   eigrp
   ```
2. Observe:
   - **Hello Packets:** Check neighbor discovery.
   - **Update Packets:** Analyze routing table updates.
3. Correlate the captured data with router logs.

```
     +-----------+        +-----------+
     | Router A  |--------| Router B  |
     +-----------+        +-----------+
           |                     |
           |                     |
     +-----------+        +-----------+
     | Router C  |--------| Router D  |
     +-----------+        +-----------+
```

## **Common Issues and Troubleshooting**
1. **Neighbor Not Forming:**
   - Check IP addressing and subnet masks.
   - Verify Hello packets using Wireshark.

2. **Route Not Advertised:**
   - Ensure the network is configured in EIGRP.
   - Check router logs for errors.

3. **High Latency:**
   - Analyze the path metric for bottlenecks.
   - Optimize links or add redundancy.

## **Key Takeaways**
1. EIGRP is a hybrid protocol ideal for large-scale networks.
2. It ensures fast convergence and loop-free paths.
3. Mastering EIGRP enhances your ability to manage enterprise networks.
