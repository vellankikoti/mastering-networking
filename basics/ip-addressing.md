# IP Addressing: Mastering the Foundations of Networking

## **Definition**
An IP (Internet Protocol) address is a unique identifier assigned to every device on a network. It enables communication by ensuring that data reaches the correct destination.

---

## **Why is IP Addressing Important?**
- **Identification:** Like a home address identifies a house, an IP address identifies a device.
- **Communication:** Enables devices to send and receive data accurately.
- **Network Design:** Helps design scalable and efficient networks.

---

## **Types of IP Addresses**

### **1. Public IP Addresses**
- **Purpose:** Used to identify devices on the internet.
- **Example:** 93.184.216.34 (assigned to a website).
- **Assigned By:** ISPs (Internet Service Providers).
- **Real-Life Analogy:** A street address visible to everyone.

---

### **2. Private IP Addresses**
- **Purpose:** Used within private networks (e.g., home, office).
- **Ranges:**
  - Class A: 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255
  - Class B: 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255
  - Class C: 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255
- **Not Routable on the Internet:** Devices with private IPs need NAT (Network Address Translation) to communicate externally.
- **Real-Life Analogy:** A room number inside a hotel (visible only within the hotel).

---

## **IPv4 and IPv6**

### **IPv4**
- **Format:** 32-bit, written as four decimal numbers separated by dots (e.g., 192.168.1.1).
- **Range:** 4.3 billion addresses.
- **Limitation:** Exhaustion due to increasing devices.

### **IPv6**
- **Format:** 128-bit, written as eight groups of hexadecimal numbers separated by colons (e.g., 2001:0db8::1).
- **Range:** Virtually unlimited.
- **Advantages:** Improved security, efficient routing, and no need for NAT.

## **Subnetting**

### **What is Subnetting?**
Subnetting is dividing a large network into smaller networks (subnets). It improves performance, security, and efficient use of IP addresses.

### **Key Terms:**
1. **Subnet Mask:** Defines the network and host portions of an IP address.
   - Example: `255.255.255.0` means the first 24 bits are for the network.
2. **CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing):** Represents subnet masks in shorthand (e.g., `/24` for `255.255.255.0`).

### **How to Calculate Subnets and Hosts:**
1. **Number of Subnets:**
   - Formula: \( 2^n \), where \( n \) is the number of bits borrowed for subnetting.
2. **Number of Hosts per Subnet:**
   - Formula: \( 2^h - 2 \), where \( h \) is the number of bits left for hosts.

### **Example:**
- IP Address: `192.168.1.0/24`
- Subnet Mask: `255.255.255.0`
- **Calculation:**
  - Borrow 2 bits for subnetting: `/26`
  - Subnets: \( 2^2 = 4 \)
  - Hosts per Subnet: \( 2^6 - 2 = 62 \)

---

## **CIDR Blocks**

### **What is CIDR?**
CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) replaces the traditional IP classes, allowing more flexible allocation of IP addresses.

### **CIDR Notation:**
- Format: `<IP Address>/<Prefix Length>`
  - Example: `192.168.1.0/24`
- **Prefix Length:** Indicates the number of bits for the network portion.

---

## **Choosing an IP Range for Your Network**

### **Considerations:**
1. **Network Size:** Determine the number of devices.
2. **Private vs Public IPs:** Use private IPs for internal communication.
3. **Scalability:** Choose a range that allows growth.
4. **Avoid Conflicts:** Ensure IP ranges don’t overlap with other networks.

### **Example Recommendation:**
For a small office with 50 devices:
- Use a private range: `192.168.1.0/24`
- Allocate subnets if needed: `/26` for 4 subnets, each with 62 hosts.

---

## **DNS (Domain Name System)**

### **What is DNS?**
DNS translates domain names (e.g., *vellanki.in*) into IP addresses (e.g., 93.184.216.34).

### **How DNS Works:**
1. You type *vellanki.in* in your browser.
2. The browser queries a DNS server.
3. The DNS server responds with the IP address.
4. Your browser uses the IP to load the website.

### **Real-Life Analogy:**
DNS is like a phone book:
- You look up a name (domain) to find a number (IP address).

---

## **Hands-On: Subnetting Practice**

### **Task 1: Calculate Subnets**
1. Given IP: `10.0.0.0/8`
2. Borrow 4 bits for subnetting.
3. Calculate:
   - Subnets: \( 2^4 = 16 \)
   - Hosts per Subnet: \( 2^{24} - 2 = 16,777,214 \)

### **Task 2: Assign Subnets**
1. Assign each subnet to a department in an office:
   - IT: `10.0.0.0/12`
   - HR: `10.16.0.0/12`
2. Verify configurations using tools like Wireshark or `ipconfig`.
